    <p>
        Fried chicken is a staple of the south east United States. It is first hand breaded with flour, egg, and bread crumbs.
        Typically, the breast, leg's, thigh's and wing's are fried.

    <p>
        Fried chicken can be made into many types of dishes and is also common among many different culture.
        On occasion fried chicken is made without breading, but usually that is not the case. It is more health,
        but it sacrifices flavor.
